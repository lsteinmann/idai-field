/**
 * These relations exists for one to many assignments between operations and contained
 * and between resources and resources contained within those. It does not necessarily
 * describe a spatial relationship (also it may, depending of the concrete resource domain and range)
 * but says that the app handles it as that structural on-to-many relationship and displays it
 * accordingly (so that operations get views, in which other resoures are listed, and resources
 * are displayed as nested within other resources). The semantics of a hierarchical relation depends on
 * its context, as constituted by the categories involved. For example a liesWithin between 'Inscription'
 * and 'Find' is, what a user would describe as meaningful relationship between them, in this case that
 * a Find can be marked with (one or more) letter-type embellishments.
